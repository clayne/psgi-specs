This is PSGI, Perl Web Server Gateway Interface -- ala Python's WSGI and Ruby's Rack.

The [PSGI protocol specification](http://github.com/plack/psgi-specs/blob/master/PSGI.pod) is currently at 1.0, and we're working on revising it to make version 1.1. See also the [FAQ](http://github.com/plack/psgi-specs/blob/master/FAQ.pod).

See the [PSGI/Plack website](http://plackperl.org/) for more links.
